# TicTacToe_PerfectGameAlgorithm
Implementation of an algorithm to play a perfect game of Tic-Tac-Toe (win or draw) using Minimax Algorithm in C++

Assigns score of +10,0,-10 in case of win,draw or lose respectively and decides action based on it.

Possible Improvement: 

(1) Bottom-up approach to improve time-complexity

(2) Extending to a game on a MxN board

(3) Applying algorithm to Four In A Row
